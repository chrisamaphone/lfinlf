This repository comprises the public LFinLF development, including
soundness and completeness of translation to canonical forms, family-level
lambdas, and constants.

Paper abstract:

We present a mechanized proof of the metatheory of LF, i.e. the decidability of
typechecking and the existence and uniqueness of canonical forms. We use a
syntactic approach in which we define a translation from LF to its canonical
forms presentation (in which only beta-short, eta-long terms are well-formed)
and prove soundness and completeness of the translation, establishing that
definitional equivalence in LF corresponds to syntactic equivalence in
canonical forms. Much recent work is based on the system of canonical
forms and hereditary substitution presented herein; our proof also serves
to reconcile that presentation with the traditional version based on
definitional equivalence.
